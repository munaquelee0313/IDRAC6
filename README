Use this to start the virtual console without the need of Java Web Start or accessing it from the web interface.

You need an old JRE... I used 1.7.0_80 from the Server JRE package. 
You don't need to install it, just extract it or copy the files in "jre" folder.

Open the viewer.jnlp file that you get by launching the virtual console from the web interface with a text editor.
Note the urls to the jar files. Download the main jar file avctKVM.jar and the libs for your operating system and architecture.
Extract the dlls from the jar libs.

Edit the bat file according to your needs.

The file structure should look like this:

start-virtual-console.bat
avctKVM.jar
jre/<jre home here>
lib/avctKVMIO.dll
lib/avmWinLib.dll
